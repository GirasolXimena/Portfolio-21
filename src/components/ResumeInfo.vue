          Homelessness is a huge problem in the Twin-Cities area. 311-AI aims to help solve that problem by
          offloading some of the issues people experiencing homelessness have to an AI chatbot. This way people
          experiencing homeless can ask simple questions to a chatbot that has up-to-date information and social
          workers can focus more time on helping people with more complicated requests. I was in charge of training
          Google Dialog Flow intents and the front end along with managing the structure of the project in React.

        <h4>Prime Scholarship Fund</h4>
        <h5>React | Express | Node.js | PostgreSQL</h5>
        <p>
          Currently there is no way for Prime Digital Academy students to cover their living costs throughout the
          14 weeks that they attend the in-class portion Prime Digital Academy. Working in a team of 4 developers, we
          built the online presence for this Scholarship Fund and created a tool for prospective students to apply and for
          the board of the Scholarship Fund to manage and fundraise quickly and efficiently. I was completely in charge
          of front end design and logic. From picking themes to connecting to APIs I did everything that was not server or
          database related.
